- **Thermal Regulation**:  
  - Radiator Fins (heat dissipation via black-body emission)  
  - Heat Redistribution Pipes (transport heat from hot to cold areas)

### 1.2. Rotational Mechanics
- **Spin Gravity**:  
  - 1 RPM generates 1g (9.81 m/s¬≤) at inner surface

- **Coriolis Effect Mitigation**:  
  - Curved terrain & gradual transition zones near axis

- **Stability Systems**:  
  - Gyroscopic Stabilizers  
  - Ion Thrusters for fine-tuning orbit and rotation

### 1.3. Interior Layout (Cylindrical Surface)
